				<p>
					Your bonsai tree need to be placed in a sunny outdoor area at all times. This can be a balcony, deck or on an outdoor table as a centerpiece. Having said that, they can be moved inside for a maximum of 2 days once every couple of months for a special event or for showing off to friends and visitors. Donâ€™t move them too often as the constant changes of their environment can deteriorate the health of your tree.
